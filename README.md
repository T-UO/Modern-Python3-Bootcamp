# Modern-Python3-Bootcamp
# My name is Tagbo
# I started out my career in finance and I am attempting to make a switch by becoming a programmer. I may re-enter the financial industry, but not in the same capacity i was working before.
# I have a creative mind and I believe becoming proficient at programming will better allow me to express my creativity
# This repository I have created is to upload files or coding that I am learning on Udemy
